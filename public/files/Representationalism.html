  <h4><a name="WHATISREP">What is Representationalism?</a></h4>

  <p>
    <a name="WHATISREP">Representationalism is the philosophical position that the world we
      see in conscious experience is not the real world itself, but merely
      a miniature virtual-reality replica of that world in an internal
      representation. Representationalism is also known
      (in psychology) as <i>Indirect Perception,</i> and (in philosophy) as
      <i>Indirect Realism,</i> or <i>Epistemological Dualism.</i>

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a name="WHATISREP">For an in-depth discussion of representationalism and alternative
      epistemological formulations see </a><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/">the
      Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</a>

  </p>
  <p>
    There are two alternative usages of the term representationalism which
    should not be confused with the term as used here. One usage is
    representationalism in art, which refers to artistic realism,
    as opposed to abstract or ornamental art. The second usage
    is a form of representationalism in philosophy, as espoused by Tye and Dretske.
    This is however a <a href="http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/%7Eslehar/epist/corruption.html">corruption</a> of the original
    usage of the term as defined in <a href="http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/%7Eslehar/epist/authoritative.html">authoritative

  <a name="REVOLUTION">
    <h4>Is representationalism becoming the dominant theory of consciousness amongst experts?</h4>
  </a>

  <p>

    There seems to be some anecdotal evidence that representationalism
    has started to become much more popular during the last decade. For
    example, Brent Allsop remembers when he first met Steve back in the
    early 90s Steve was the first and only representationalists he had
    the chance to meet and talk with at the time. Yet now, it seems,
    there are many more representationaists, and representationalists
    ideas seem much more prevalent in the literature.

  </p>
  <p>

    Wanting to rigorously know just how many representationalists there
    really are, and if there was more to this anecdotal evidence that
    there might be a scientific revolution going on was part of the
    motivation for creating canonizer.com and starting with topics on
    theories of consciousness.

  </p>
  <p>

    When Brent Allsop first started topics on consciousness, he thought
    that representationalism was indeed still very much a minority view.
    He expected some other theories of consciousness to quickly establish
    dominance over representationalism, though he wasn't sure which
    theories this might be. Of course the already more than 18,000 plus
    publications already in Chalmers' <a href="http://consc.net/mindpapers">Mind Papers</a> bibliography, not
    to mention the gazillions of websites being created on this topic, is
    of no use to anyone since no mortal can be expected to produce any
    kind of comprehensive survey of that mess. Brent simply wanted to get
    a general unbiased idea of what the best competing theories were, what
    the most popular terminality to describe them was, and who was in what
    camp.

  </p>
  <p>

    An open survey topic has been started at canonizer.com with the goal
    of colaberatively developing a comprehensive survey of the all the
    most well accepted theories of consciousness. Already the <a
      href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/88/6">Consciousness is
      Representational and Real</a> camp is clearly in the lead. The
    process is still very early, and the number of experts that have
    'canonized' their beliefs about consciousness is still far from
    comprehensive, but the current amount of support that the
    representationalism camp is achieving compared to any other theory is
    very surprising, even shocking. While it is true that Brent Allsop,
    being himself a representationalist, is surely biasing the data at
    this early stage, perhaps working harder to recruit
    representationalists than supporters of other theories. But he is not
    intentionally doing this. He is recruiting people to participate in
    all possible forums, and of all possible beliefs, making explicit
    efforts not to only recruit representationalists. But it is almost as
    if people whose works are not representational are fearful of
    participating as if they might realize their ideas are not nearly as
    compelling?


  </p>
  <p>

    Whether the current tentative data is biased or not, as an ever larger
    percentage of <a href="http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/81">experts</a>
    'canonize' their beliefs this will obviously become less of a
    possibility. There does seem to already be clear evidence that a
    revolution is taking place in this field as we speak. Members of the
    representational camp believe no other theory will ever be able to
    match the amount of scientific consensus going forward, and that
    ultimately demonstrable scientific evidence will convert all others to
    this camp making it very good possibility of being THE ONE true theory
    of consciousness.

      philosophy of <i>Identity Theory</i>, i.e. that mind is not
      separate and distinct from brain, but mind is identically equal to
      the functioning of the physical brain. In other words, the sensory
      qualia, such as the experience of color, are physical states of
      the physical brain, and consciousness is expressed as modulations
      of the sensory qualia across space and time. This was a
      breakthrough for the representationalist position, even though not
