That should not be interpreted as a license for behavior that shuts down legitimate voices through targeted disruption as outlined above. Those who work to limit the participation and expression of others leave us with no choice but to establish boundaries and limits on disruptors. This will make for an inclusive and productive conversation for all people of good will, which is what Canonizer is all about.</span></li>
